# CloudCart Microservices - GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
CloudCart is a scalable microservices-based e-commerce platform built with ASP.NET Core, featuring distributed architecture with API Gateway pattern, message queues for async communication, and distributed transactions using saga pattern.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8.0 Web API
- **API Gateway**: Ocelot
- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer Tokens
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes

## Architecture Pattern
- Microservices Architecture
- API Gateway Pattern (Ocelot)
- Event-Driven Communication (RabbitMQ)
- Repository Pattern
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions

## Project Structure
- **src/ApiGateway** - Ocelot API Gateway for routing
- **src/Services/ProductCatalog** - Product management service
- **src/Services/ShoppingCart** - Shopping cart service
- **src/Services/Order** - Order processing service
- **src/Services/Payment** - Payment processing service
- **src/Services/User** - User management and authentication
- **src/BuildingBlocks/EventBus** - RabbitMQ event bus
- **src/BuildingBlocks/Common** - Shared libraries

## Development Guidelines
1. Each microservice follows clean architecture principles
2. Use async/await for all I/O operations
3. Implement health check endpoints for all services
4. Use repository pattern for data access
5. Implement proper error handling and logging
6. Follow RESTful API conventions
7. Use DTOs for data transfer between layers
8. Implement request validation using FluentValidation

## Project Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All core components have been successfully implemented and tested. The solution builds without errors.
