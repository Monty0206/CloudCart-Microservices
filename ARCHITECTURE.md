# CloudCart Microservices - Architecture Deep Dive

## 🎓 Educational Overview

This project demonstrates **enterprise-grade microservices architecture** using modern .NET technologies. It showcases best practices, design patterns, and real-world solutions to distributed systems challenges.

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. **Microservices Architecture**
Each service is:
- **Independently Deployable**: Can update Product Service without touching Order Service
- **Technology Agnostic**: Each service could use different databases or languages
- **Scalable**: Can scale services individually based on demand
- **Resilient**: Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system

### 2. **API Gateway Pattern (Ocelot)**
**Problem**: Clients don't want to call 5 different services with 5 different URLs
**Solution**: Single entry point that routes requests to appropriate services

```
Client → API Gateway → Routes to correct microservice
         (Port 5000)
```

**Benefits**:
- Simplified client logic
- Centralized authentication
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- Service discovery integration

### 3. **Event-Driven Architecture (RabbitMQ)**
**Problem**: Services need to communicate without tight coupling
**Solution**: Publish/Subscribe pattern with message queue

```
Service A → Publishes Event → RabbitMQ → All Subscribed Services Receive
```

**Real Example - Order Flow**:
```
1. User places order
   └→ OrderCreatedEvent published

2. Payment Service subscribes to OrderCreatedEvent
   └→ Processes payment
   └→ Publishes PaymentProcessedEvent

3. Order Service subscribes to PaymentProcessedEvent
   └→ Updates order status
   └→ Publishes OrderConfirmedEvent

4. Product Service subscribes to OrderConfirmedEvent
   └→ Reduces stock quantity
   └→ Publishes ProductStockUpdatedEvent

5. Notification Service subscribes to all events
   └→ Sends emails to customer at each step
```

**Why This Is Powerful**:
- Services don't know about each other
- Easy to add new services (just subscribe to events)
- Resilient (messages queue if service is down)
- Asynchronous processing (better performance)

### 4. **Repository Pattern**
**Problem**: Business logic shouldn't depend on database implementation
**Solution**: Abstract data access behind interfaces

```
Controller → Service → Repository Interface → Repository Implementation → Database
                              ↑
                         (Mockable for testing)
```

**Benefits**:
- Easy to switch databases (MongoDB → PostgreSQL)
- Simplified unit testing
- Consistent data access patterns
- Centralized query logic

### 5. **Saga Pattern (Distributed Transactions)**
**Problem**: Traditional ACID transactions don't work across microservices
**Solution**: Choreography-based saga with compensating transactions

**Example - Order Processing Saga**:
```
Success Path:
Create Order → Process Payment → Reserve Inventory → Confirm Order
     ✓              ✓                  ✓                ✓

Failure Path (Compensation):
Create Order → Process Payment → Reserve Inventory ✗ → Cancel Payment → Cancel Order
     ✓              ✓                  ✗                    ✓              ✓
```

Each service publishes events and listens for events to coordinate the saga.

### 6. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
**Concept**: Separate read and write operations

```
Commands (Write):        Queries (Read):
CreateProduct           GetProducts (with pagination)
UpdateProduct           SearchProducts
DeleteProduct           GetProductById
UpdateStock             GetProductsByCategory
```

**Benefits**:
- Optimized read models
- Can use different databases for reads vs writes
- Better scalability
- Clear separation of concerns

## 🔧 Technology Stack Explained

### Why MongoDB?
- **Flexible Schema**: Products can have varying attributes
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Sharding for massive datasets
- **JSON-like Documents**: Natural fit for REST APIs
- **High Performance**: Fast reads for product catalogs

### Why RabbitMQ?
- **Reliable Messaging**: Messages aren't lost
- **Flexible Routing**: Topic exchanges for pattern matching
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Handle failed messages
- **Mature Ecosystem**: Well-tested in production

### Why Docker & Kubernetes?
- **Consistency**: "Works on my machine" → "Works everywhere"
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling based on load
- **Orchestration**: Self-healing, load balancing
- **DevOps**: CI/CD integration

## 📊 Data Flow Example: Adding a Product

### 1. Client Request
```http
POST http://localhost:5000/products
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Laptop",
  "price": 999.99,
  "stockQuantity": 50
}
```

### 2. API Gateway (Ocelot)
- Receives request on port 5000
- Checks rate limiting
- Routes to Product Catalog Service (port 5001)

### 3. Product Catalog Service
```
ProductsController.CreateProduct()
  ↓
IProductService.CreateProductAsync()
  ↓
IProductRepository.CreateAsync()
  ↓
MongoDB
```

### 4. Response Flow
```
MongoDB → Repository → Service → Controller → API Gateway → Client
         (Domain)    (Business)  (HTTP)        (Routing)
```

### 5. Event Publishing (if stock changes)
```
Service → EventBus → RabbitMQ → Subscribed Services
                     (Topic Exchange)
```

## 🎯 Design Principles Applied

### SOLID Principles
- **S**ingle Responsibility: Each class has one reason to change
- **O**pen/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: Interfaces can be swapped
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, focused interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concrete types

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Generic repository pattern
- Shared DTOs and models in Common library
- Reusable event bus implementation

### Separation of Concerns
- Controllers: HTTP/REST concerns
- Services: Business logic
- Repositories: Data access
- Models: Domain entities
- DTOs: Data transfer

## 🔒 Security Considerations (Production Checklist)

### Implemented
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Health checks for monitoring
- ✅ Input validation through DTOs

### To Implement (Next Steps)
- 🔲 JWT authentication
- 🔲 API key for service-to-service
- 🔲 HTTPS/TLS certificates
- 🔲 Secret management (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- 🔲 Rate limiting (implemented in Ocelot, needs configuration)
- 🔲 Input sanitization
- 🔲 SQL injection prevention (N/A for MongoDB, but principle applies)

## 📈 Scalability Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling
```
Load Balancer
     ├─→ Product Service Instance 1
     ├─→ Product Service Instance 2
     └─→ Product Service Instance 3
```

### Database Scaling
- MongoDB Sharding: Distribute data across servers
- Read Replicas: Separate read and write databases
- Caching Layer: Redis for frequently accessed data

### Message Queue Scaling
- Multiple RabbitMQ nodes in a cluster
- Queue mirroring for high availability
- Consumer scaling (multiple instances processing messages)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```csharp
// Test service logic with mocked repository
var mockRepo = new Mock<IProductRepository>();
var service = new ProductService(mockRepo.Object, mockEventBus.Object);
```

### Integration Tests
```csharp
// Test with real database (TestContainers)
using var mongoContainer = new MongoDbContainer();
await mongoContainer.StartAsync();
// Run tests against real MongoDB instance
```

### End-to-End Tests
```csharp
// Test entire flow through API Gateway
var client = new HttpClient();
var response = await client.PostAsync("http://localhost:5000/products", ...);
```

## 🚀 Deployment Pipeline

### Local Development
```bash
docker-compose up  # Start all services locally
```

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions Example)
```yaml
Build → Test → Docker Build → Push to Registry → Deploy to K8s
```

### Kubernetes Deployment
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
# Creates: Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, Deployments
```
